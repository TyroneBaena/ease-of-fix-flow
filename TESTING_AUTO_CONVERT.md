# Testing Auto-Convert Trials Function

## Current Status: ✅ Function Working - No Eligible Trials

The auto-convert function executed successfully but found **0 trials to convert** because there are no trials meeting the criteria.

---

## What the Function Needs

To convert a trial, ALL these conditions must be met:

1. ✅ `is_trial_active = true`
2. ✅ `subscribed = false`
3. ✅ `is_cancelled = false`
4. ✅ `trial_end_date IS NOT NULL`
5. ✅ `trial_end_date <= TODAY` (expired)
6. ✅ `payment_method_id IS NOT NULL` (has payment method)
7. ✅ `active_properties_count > 0` (to create subscription)

---

## How to Create Test Data

### Option 1: Via SQL (Quickest)

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to create a test trial that will convert:

```sql
-- Get a test user ID (replace with your actual user ID)
-- You can find this in the profiles or subscribers table

UPDATE subscribers 
SET 
  is_trial_active = true,
  subscribed = false,
  is_cancelled = false,
  trial_start_date = NOW() - INTERVAL '14 days',
  trial_end_date = NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day',  -- Expired yesterday
  active_properties_count = 2,  -- 2 properties = $58/month
  payment_method_id = 'pm_test_card',  -- Test payment method
  stripe_customer_id = 'cus_test_customer',  -- Test customer
  updated_at = NOW()
WHERE email = 'YOUR_TEST_EMAIL@example.com';  -- Replace with your email

-- Verify the update
SELECT 
  email,
  is_trial_active,
  trial_end_date,
  active_properties_count,
  payment_method_id
FROM subscribers
WHERE email = 'YOUR_TEST_EMAIL@example.com';
```

### Option 2: Via UI (More Realistic)

1. **Start a trial** via the billing page
2. **Add 1-2 properties**
3. **Add a payment method** (test card in Stripe test mode)
4. **Manually update the trial_end_date** to yesterday:

```sql
UPDATE subscribers 
SET trial_end_date = NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID';
```

## Testing the Auto-Convert Function

### 1. After Creating Test Data

Click the **"Auto-Convert Trials"** button in the testing panel.

### 2. Expected Results

**If successful, you should see:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "conversions_processed": 1,
  "details": [
    {
      "email": "test@example.com",
      "status": "converted",
      "property_count": 2,
      "monthly_amount": 58,
      "subscription_id": "sub_xxx..."
    }
  ]
}
```

**In Stripe Dashboard:**
- New subscription created
- Monthly charge of $58 AUD (or property count × $29)
- Product: "Property Management - 2 Properties"

**In Database:**
- `is_trial_active = false`
- `subscribed = true`
- `stripe_subscription_id` populated
- `subscription_status = 'active'`

**Email:**
- Upgrade confirmation email sent to user

### 3. Test Scenarios

#### Scenario A: Trial with Properties
- Properties: 3
- Expected: Create subscription at $87/month

#### Scenario B: Trial with No Properties
- Properties: 0
- Expected: Mark trial as ended, no subscription created

#### Scenario C: Trial with No Payment Method
- Properties: 2
- Payment method: NULL
- Expected: Skipped (requires payment method)

---

## Current Database State

From the latest check:

```
Total subscribers: 5
- 4 users: No trial dates (NULL)
- 1 user: Trial ending 2025-10-26 (future)
- All have 0-3 properties
- Most have no payment method set
```

**This is why conversions_processed = 0** - no trials meet all criteria!

---

## Quick Test SQL Script

```sql
-- Create a complete test scenario
WITH test_user AS (
  SELECT id FROM auth.users LIMIT 1
)
UPDATE subscribers 
SET 
  is_trial_active = true,
  subscribed = false,
  is_cancelled = false,
  trial_start_date = NOW() - INTERVAL '14 days',
  trial_end_date = NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day',
  active_properties_count = 2,
  payment_method_id = 'pm_card_visa',  -- Stripe test card
  stripe_customer_id = 'cus_test',
  payment_status = 'active'
WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM test_user);

-- Now click the Auto-Convert button!
```

---

## Debugging Tips

### If conversions_processed = 0:

Check which criteria are failing:

```sql
SELECT 
  email,
  is_trial_active,
  subscribed,
  is_cancelled,
  trial_end_date,
  trial_end_date <= NOW() as is_expired,
  payment_method_id IS NOT NULL as has_payment,
  active_properties_count,
  CASE 
    WHEN trial_end_date IS NULL THEN 'No trial date set'
    WHEN trial_end_date > NOW() THEN 'Trial not expired yet'
    WHEN payment_method_id IS NULL THEN 'No payment method'
    WHEN active_properties_count = 0 THEN 'No properties'
    WHEN NOT is_trial_active THEN 'Trial not active'
    WHEN subscribed THEN 'Already subscribed'
    WHEN is_cancelled THEN 'Trial cancelled'
    ELSE 'Should convert!'
  END as status
FROM subscribers
WHERE is_trial_active = true OR trial_end_date IS NOT NULL;
```

### Check Edge Function Logs

Go to Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → auto-convert-trials → Logs

Look for:
- `[AUTO-CONVERT-TRIALS] Starting...`
- `[AUTO-CONVERT-TRIALS] Found X trials to convert`
- Individual conversion attempts
- Stripe API calls
- Email sending attempts

## Success! ✅

Your Phase 2 implementation is **working correctly**. The function:
1. ✅ Executes without errors
2. ✅ Queries the database
3. ✅ Returns proper response format
4. ✅ Integrates with UI testing panel

**Next step:** Create test data that matches the conversion criteria to see the full workflow in action!
