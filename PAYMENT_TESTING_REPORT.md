## 🧪 Complete Payment Flow Analysis

### **PHASE 1: Critical Security & Enforcement** ✅

#### 1.1 Access Control Middleware
**File:** `src/hooks/useSubscriptionGuard.tsx`

| Test Case | Expected | Status |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Trial expired | Block + redirect | ✅ Lines 47-67 |
| Subscription cancelled | Block + reactivate prompt | ✅ Lines 70-87 |
| 3 failed payments | Suspend account | ✅ Lines 109-127 |
| No subscription | Block access | ✅ Lines 90-107 |

**Critical Fix:**
```typescript
fallbackPath = '/billing-security'  // Fixed routing bug
```

#### 1.2 Payment Method at Signup
**File:** `src/components/auth/PaymentMethodSetup.tsx`

**Flow:** User signup → Payment required → Trial activates

**Database Evidence:**
```sql
email: "rowybe@forexzig.com",
payment_method_id: "pm_1SGeQmERrSyHgYuusHCEJrHk" ✅
```

---

### **PHASE 2: Stripe Webhook Infrastructure** ✅

**File:** `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts`

| Event | Handler | Database Updates |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| `invoice.payment_succeeded` | ✅ | Reset failures, set active |
| `invoice.payment_failed` | ✅ | Increment count, pause at 3 |
| `customer.subscription.deleted` | ✅ | Mark cancelled |
| `customer.subscription.updated` | ✅ | Sync status + dates |
| `setup_intent.succeeded` | ✅ | Save payment_method_id |

**Security:** Webhook signature verified on line 41

---

### **PHASE 3: Automated Billing Engine** ✅

#### 3.1 Trial Auto-Conversion
**File:** `supabase/functions/auto-convert-trials/index.ts`

**Cron:** `pg_cron` extension verified active (v1.6)

**Logic:**
```typescript
// Only converts trials with payment methods
.not("payment_method_id", "is", null)
.lte("trial_end_date", now)
```

**Test Results:**
- 0 properties → Trial ends, no subscription ✅
- 2 properties → $58 subscription created ✅  
- No payment method → Skipped ✅

#### 3.2 Metered Billing
```typescript
usage_type: "metered",  // Usage-based billing
unit_amount: 2900  // $29 per property
```

**Property Sync:** Database trigger confirmed:
```
"Updated property count for user: 2"
```

---

### **PHASE 4: Failed Payment Handling** ✅

**Hook:** `src/hooks/useFailedPaymentStatus.tsx`

| Failures | Status | Access | Banner |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0 | active | ✅ Full | None |
| 1-2 | failed | ✅ Full | ⚠️ Warning |
| 3+ | suspended | 🚫 Blocked | 🔴 Critical |

**Grace Period:** 7 days after 3rd failure
