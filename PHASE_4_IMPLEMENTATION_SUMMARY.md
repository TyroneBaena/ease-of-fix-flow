# Phase 4: Failed Payment Handling - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

All Phase 4 components have been successfully implemented and integrated with existing Phase 1-3 infrastructure.

---

## üìã Completed Features

### 1. ‚úÖ Smart Retry Logic (Enhanced Webhook)

**File:** `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts`

**Implementation:**
- **Attempt #1:** Sets `payment_status = 'past_due'`, sends "first failure" email, Stripe auto-retries in 3 days
- **Attempt #2:** Maintains `payment_status = 'past_due'`, sends "second failure" email with urgent warning, Stripe auto-retries in 3 days
- **Attempt #3:** Sets `payment_status = 'suspended'`, sends "final notice" email, **pauses subscription** to prevent further charges

**Key Logic:**
```typescript
const paymentStatus = newFailedCount >= 3 ? 'suspended' : 'past_due';

// Pause subscription after 3rd failure
if (newFailedCount >= 3 && subscriber?.stripe_subscription_id) {
  await stripe.subscriptions.update(subscriber.stripe_subscription_id, {
    pause_collection: { behavior: 'void' },
  });
}
```

**Differentiated Email Types:**
- `first_failure`: Reassuring tone, auto-retry notification
- `second_failure`: Urgent warning, final attempt notice
- `final_notice`: Critical alert, account suspended message

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Suspension & Access Control

**File:** `src/hooks/useSubscriptionGuard.tsx`

**Updates:**
- Check 4 updated to block access immediately when `failed_payment_count >= 3`
- Removed grace period logic (suspended = instant access block)
- Toast notification with "Update Payment" action

**Logic:**
```typescript
if (subscribed && failedCount >= 3) {
  setGuardResult({
    hasAccess: false,
    reason: 'grace_period_expired',
    message: 'Your account has been suspended...',
  });
  // Redirects to billing page with urgent toast
}
```

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Suspended Account UI

**File:** `src/components/billing/SuspendedAccountBanner.tsx` (NEW)

**Features:**
- Critical red alert banner displayed on billing page
- Shows failed attempt count
- Two action buttons:
  1. **"Update Payment Method"** - Opens payment setup flow
  2. **"Reactivate After Update"** - Calls reactivation API

**Integration:**
```typescript
// BillingManagementPage.tsx
{failedPaymentStatus.failedCount >= 3 && (
  <SuspendedAccountBanner 
    failedCount={failedPaymentStatus.failedCount}
  />
)}
```

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Reactivation Edge Function

**File:** `supabase/functions/reactivate-subscription/index.ts` (NEW)

**Workflow:**
1. Authenticates user via JWT
2. Fetches subscriber from database
3. Verifies valid payment method exists in Stripe
4. Resumes paused subscription (if applicable)
5. **Resets failed payment count to 0**
6. **Sets payment_status = 'active'**
7. Updates payment_method_id
8. Sends reactivation confirmation email
9. Returns success response

**API Endpoint:**
```
POST /functions/v1/reactivate-subscription
Authorization: Bearer <user_jwt>
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Subscription reactivated successfully",
  "payment_status": "active",
  "failed_payment_count": 0
}
```

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Reactivation Confirmation Email

**File:** `supabase/functions/send-reactivation-confirmation/index.ts` (NEW)

**Content:**
- Welcome back message with celebration emoji
- Confirmation of restored access
- Next steps explanation
- Dashboard link
- Professional styling with green theme

---

### 6. ‚úÖ Enhanced Failed Payment Emails

**File:** `supabase/functions/send-payment-failed/index.ts`

**Three Email Types:**

#### First Failure (Attempt #1)
- **Subject:** "Payment Failed - We'll Try Again in 3 Days"
- **Tone:** Reassuring, informative
- **Color:** Amber (#f59e0b)
- **Content:** Auto-retry notification, no panic

#### Second Failure (Attempt #2)
- **Subject:** "IMPORTANT: Payment Failed Again - Final Attempt in 3 Days"
- **Tone:** Urgent, warning
- **Color:** Red (#ef4444)
- **Content:** Final attempt notice, strong call-to-action

#### Final Notice (Attempt #3)
- **Subject:** "üö® URGENT: Account Suspended - Update Payment Method Now"
- **Tone:** Critical, immediate action required
- **Color:** Dark Red (#dc2626)
- **Content:** 
  - Account suspended banner
  - All features disabled notice
  - Immediate action instructions
  - Reactivation steps

---

## üîÑ Complete User Flow

### Scenario: Payment Method Expires

1. **Day 1 - First Failure:**
   - Stripe attempts charge ‚Üí Fails
   - Webhook increments `failed_payment_count` to 1
   - Sets `payment_status = 'past_due'`
   - Sends "first failure" email
   - Stripe schedules auto-retry in 3 days
   - **User still has full access**

2. **Day 4 - Second Failure:**
   - Stripe auto-retries ‚Üí Fails again
   - Webhook increments `failed_payment_count` to 2
   - Sends "second failure" email with urgent warning
   - Stripe schedules final auto-retry in 3 days
   - **User still has full access**

3. **Day 7 - Third Failure:**
   - Stripe auto-retries ‚Üí Fails third time
   - Webhook increments `failed_payment_count` to 3
   - Sets `payment_status = 'suspended'`
   - **Pauses Stripe subscription**
   - Sends "final notice" email
   - **useSubscriptionGuard blocks all access**
   - User redirected to billing page with suspended banner

4. **User Updates Payment:**
   - Clicks "Update Payment Method"
   - Adds new card via Stripe Elements
   - Clicks "Reactivate After Update"
   - Calls `/functions/v1/reactivate-subscription`
   - API verifies payment method
   - Resumes subscription
   - Resets `failed_payment_count = 0`
   - Sets `payment_status = 'active'`
   - **Immediate access restored**
   - Receives welcome back email

---

## üîê Security Measures

1. **JWT Authentication:** Reactivation API requires valid user JWT
2. **Payment Verification:** Confirms payment method exists before reactivation
3. **Stripe Sync:** Ensures subscription state matches Stripe reality
4. **Database Consistency:** Atomic updates prevent race conditions
5. **Suspension Enforcement:** Access control at application layer via `useSubscriptionGuard`

---

## üìä Database Schema Updates

### subscribers table (existing columns used):
- `failed_payment_count`: Incremented on each failure
- `payment_status`: Values: `'active' | 'past_due' | 'suspended'`
- `last_payment_attempt`: Timestamp of last failure
- `payment_method_id`: Updated on successful reactivation

**No new columns required** - Phase 4 uses existing schema from Phase 1-3.
