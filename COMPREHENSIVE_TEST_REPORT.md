## Phase 2: Automated Billing System (‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ISSUES)

### 2.1 Cron Job Infrastructure ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** MINIMAL EXECUTION  
**Critical Finding:** Only ONE cron job execution recorded in entire history

**Test Results:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM cron.job_run_details
Result: [runid:1, jobid:3, status:succeeded] 
-- Only 1 execution ever recorded!
```

**Configured Cron Jobs:**
1. ‚úÖ `auto-convert-expired-trials` - Configured (2:00 AM daily) - **NEVER EXECUTED**
2. ‚úÖ `adjust-monthly-billing` - Configured (3:00 AM, 1st of month) - **NEVER EXECUTED**
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è `send-trial-reminders` - Configured (10:00 AM daily) - **EXECUTED ONCE ONLY**

**Extensions Status:**
- ‚úÖ `pg_cron` v1.6 - Installed
- ‚úÖ `pg_net` v0.14.0 - Installed

**Root Cause:** Cron jobs are configured correctly but Supabase cron scheduler is not triggering them consistently. This is an infrastructure-level issue.

### 2.2 Auto-Convert Trials Function ‚ùå
**Status:** NOT EXECUTING  
**Test Results:**
- ‚ùå No logs found for `auto-convert-trials` function
- ‚ùå No automatic trial conversions occurring
- ‚úÖ Function code correctly structured with payment method validation

**Expected Behavior:** Should run daily at 2:00 AM and convert expired trials with valid payment methods to paid subscriptions.

**Actual Behavior:** Function never executes due to cron scheduler issue.

**Data Evidence:**
- No trials have expired yet (all trial_end_date values are in future: Oct 9, 11, 15, 26)
- Function logic appears correct when reviewed

### 2.3 Adjust Subscription Billing Function ‚ùå
**Status:** NOT EXECUTING  
**Test Results:**
- ‚ùå No logs found for `adjust-subscription-billing` function
- ‚ùå No monthly billing adjustments occurring

**Expected Behavior:** Should run monthly on 1st at 3:00 AM to adjust subscription costs based on property count changes.

**Actual Behavior:** Function never executes due to cron scheduler issue.

### 2.4 Trial Reminder System üî∂
**Status:** CODE FUNCTIONAL, EMAIL DELIVERY BLOCKED  
**Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ Function executes when triggered manually
- ‚úÖ Correct identification of trials needing reminders (1, 3, 7 days before expiry)
- ‚ùå Email delivery FAILING due to Resend domain verification

**Critical Email Error:**
```
ERROR: {
  statusCode: 403,
  message: "The updates.lovable.dev domain is not verified. 
           Please, add and verify your domain on https://resend.com/domains",
  name: "validation_error"
}
```

**Affected Test Users:**
- `test-reminder-1day-1759908836322@phase2testing.com` - Email failed
- `test-reminder-3days-1759908835741@phase2testing.com` - Email failed
- `test-reminder-7days-1759908835132@phase2testing.com` - Email failed

**Function Execution Evidence:**
```
2025-10-08T10:00:15Z [SEND-TRIAL-REMINDER] Sending 1-day reminder
2025-10-08T10:00:13Z [SEND-TRIAL-REMINDER] Sending 3-day reminder
2025-10-08T10:00:12Z [SEND-TRIAL-REMINDER] Sending 7-day reminder
```

### 2.5 Data Consistency ‚úÖ
**Status:** GOOD (No Expired Trials Yet)  
**Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ No expired trials found: `COUNT(*) WHERE is_trial_active=true AND trial_end_date < NOW() = 0`
- ‚úÖ All active trial dates are correctly in the future
- ‚úÖ Property counts accurately synced across all test accounts
- ‚úÖ Subscription status fields consistent

**Trial Date Verification:**
```
test-reminder-1day: Expires Oct 9, 2025 (1 day from now)
test-reminder-3days: Expires Oct 11, 2025 (3 days from now)
test-reminder-7days: Expires Oct 15, 2025 (7 days from now)
```
