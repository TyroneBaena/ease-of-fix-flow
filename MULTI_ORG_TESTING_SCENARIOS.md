# Multi-Organization Testing Scenarios

## üîç Overview
This document outlines comprehensive testing scenarios for multi-organization functionality where managers can be assigned to multiple organizations.

## ‚úÖ FIXED CRITICAL ISSUES
- **Email Relay Token Security** - Fixed RLS policies to prevent cross-organization token access
- **Budget Categories Exposure** - Added organization-based isolation
- **Quote Organization Validation** - Enhanced security checks in quote operations

## üß™ TEST SCENARIOS TO VERIFY

### 1. User Invitation to Multiple Organizations

#### Scenario A: Manager Invited to Second Organization
**Steps:**
1. Admin in Org A invites existing manager from Org B
2. Manager should receive invitation email
3. Manager should be added to Org A with proper role
4. Manager should see both organizations in switcher

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ User gets added to `user_organizations` table with correct org_id
- ‚úÖ User can switch between organizations
- ‚úÖ Data remains isolated per organization
- ‚úÖ No access to cross-organization data

#### Scenario B: New User Invited to Organization
**Steps:**
1. Admin invites completely new user
2. User signs up and gets assigned to inviting admin's organization
3. User should only see their assigned organization initially

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ User profile created with correct organization_id
- ‚úÖ User organization membership created
- ‚úÖ User cannot see other organizations' data

### 2. Organization Switching

#### Scenario A: Successful Organization Switch
**Steps:**
1. Manager with access to multiple orgs logs in
2. Manager switches from Org A to Org B
3. Dashboard data should update to show Org B's data only

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ `session_organization_id` updated in profiles table
- ‚úÖ Current organization context updated
- ‚úÖ All data queries filtered to new organization
- ‚úÖ UI reflects current organization

#### Scenario B: Organization Switch Persistence
**Steps:**
1. Manager switches to Org B
2. Manager refreshes page or logs out/in
3. Should remain in Org B (last selected organization)

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Session organization persists across page refreshes
- ‚úÖ User returns to last selected organization on login

### 3. Data Isolation Testing

#### Scenario A: Maintenance Requests Isolation
**Steps:**
1. Manager in Org A creates maintenance request
2. Manager switches to Org B
3. Should not see Org A's requests

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ RLS policies prevent cross-organization data access
- ‚úÖ Dashboard shows only current organization's requests
- ‚úÖ No data leakage in API responses

#### Scenario B: Contractor Isolation
**Steps:**
1. Manager in Org A views contractors list
2. Should only see contractors assigned to Org A
3. Cannot assign contractors from other organizations

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Contractors filtered by organization_id
- ‚úÖ Quote requests only go to same-organization contractors
- ‚úÖ No cross-organization contractor assignments

#### Scenario C: Properties Isolation
**Steps:**
1. Manager views properties in current organization
2. Switches to different organization
3. Should see different set of properties

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Properties properly filtered by organization
- ‚úÖ No access to other organizations' properties
- ‚úÖ Property-specific requests properly isolated

### 4. Permission and Role Testing

#### Scenario A: Role Consistency Across Organizations
**Steps:**
1. User has 'manager' role in Org A and 'admin' role in Org B
2. Switch between organizations
3. Permissions should change based on current organization role

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control works per organization
- ‚úÖ UI elements show/hide based on current org role
- ‚úÖ API calls respect current organization role

#### Scenario B: Organization Admin Actions
**Steps:**
1. User with admin role in one org tries admin actions
2. User switches to org where they have manager role
3. Admin actions should be restricted

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Admin functions disabled in organizations where user is not admin
- ‚úÖ User management restricted to appropriate organizations
- ‚úÖ Settings access controlled per organization

### 5. Edge Cases and Error Scenarios

#### Scenario A: Removed from Organization
**Steps:**
1. Admin removes user from organization while user is active
2. User should be redirected or see appropriate error
3. User should lose access to that organization's data

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ User receives appropriate notification
- ‚úÖ Organization removed from available organizations list
- ‚úÖ User switched to remaining organization or logged out

#### Scenario B: Organization Switching Failures
**Steps:**
1. Network error during organization switch
2. Database error during organization switch
3. Should handle gracefully without leaving user in bad state

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Error messages displayed appropriately
- ‚úÖ User remains in original organization on failure
- ‚úÖ No partial state updates

#### Scenario C: Concurrent Organization Access
**Steps:**
1. Same user logged in from multiple devices
2. Switches organization on one device
3. Other device should handle the change appropriately

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Session synchronization works correctly
- ‚úÖ No data inconsistencies between sessions
- ‚úÖ Appropriate notifications or data refresh

### 6. Database Integrity Testing

#### Scenario A: Organization ID Validation
**Steps:**
1. Attempt to create maintenance request with wrong organization_id
2. Attempt to assign contractor from different organization
3. Should be prevented by database constraints

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Database triggers prevent cross-organization assignments
- ‚úÖ RLS policies block unauthorized data access
- ‚úÖ Application displays appropriate error messages

#### Scenario B: Foreign Key Constraints
**Steps:**
1. Check all tables have proper organization_id references
2. Verify cascade delete behavior
3. Test orphaned record prevention

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ All multi-tenant tables have organization_id column
- ‚úÖ Foreign key constraints properly enforce relationships
- ‚úÖ No orphaned records across organizations

## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY CHECKS

### 1. Cross-Organization Data Leakage
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Email relay tokens properly isolated
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Budget categories organization-scoped
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **VERIFY**: All API endpoints respect organization boundaries
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **VERIFY**: No data visible in network requests from other orgs

### 2. Authentication Bypass Attempts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **TEST**: Direct API calls with manipulated organization_id
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **TEST**: JWT token manipulation attempts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **TEST**: Session hijacking between organizations

### 3. SQL Injection via Organization Context
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **TEST**: Organization ID parameter injection
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **TEST**: RLS policy bypass attempts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **TEST**: Database function parameter manipulation
