## 🔄 **COMPLETE PAYMENT FLOW ANALYSIS**

### Flow 1: New User Signup → Trial Activation ✅

**Components Tested**:
- `src/components/auth/EnhancedSignupFlow.tsx`
- `supabase/functions/create-trial-subscription/index.ts`
- `src/contexts/subscription/SubscriptionContext.tsx`

**Test Steps**:
1. User fills signup form (name, email, password)
2. User enters credit card information (Stripe Elements)
3. System creates Supabase auth account
4. Edge function `create-trial-subscription` is called
5. Stripe customer and SetupIntent are created
6. Subscriber record created with trial dates
7. User profile and organization created
8. Success page shown

**Findings**:
- ✅ **WORKING**: Trial creation edge function properly implemented
- ✅ **WORKING**: Fallback mechanism if edge function fails (direct DB insert)
- ✅ **WORKING**: 30-day trial period correctly calculated
- ✅ **WORKING**: Payment method collected but not charged
- ✅ **WORKING**: Proper error handling and user feedback
- ✅ **WORKING**: JWT authentication correctly validated
- ⚠️ **NOTE**: Edge function uses `verify_jwt = true` in config.toml

**Security Checks**:
- ✅ Password validation (min 6 chars)
- ✅ Email validation
- ✅ Password confirmation matching
- ✅ Stripe publishable key properly configured
- ✅ No sensitive data in logs

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- ✅ Email already registered

- `src/config/stripe.ts`

**Test Steps**:
1. Trial user attempts to add first property
2. Trial user attempts to add second property
3. System enforces 1-property limit
4. Property count syncs to subscribers table

**Findings**:
- ✅ **WORKING**: 1-property limit enforced for trial users
- ✅ **WORKING**: Clear error message with upgrade CTA

**Code Verification**:
```typescript
// Property limit enforcement (usePropertyForm.ts:79-100)
if (!existingProperty && isTrialActive && !subscribed) {
  if (currentPropertyCount >= STRIPE_CONFIG.trial.maxProperties) {
    toast.error('Trial accounts are limited to 1 property. Please upgrade.');
    return; // ✅ Blocks property creation
  }
}
```

**Database Trigger**:
- ✅ `sync_property_count_to_subscriber()` trigger fires on INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE

  subscribed: true,
  subscription_tier: 'paid',
  stripe_subscription_id: newSubscription.id, // ✅ FIXED: Now saves subscription ID

    timestamp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
    action: 'set', // ✅ Replace quantity (not increment)
  }
);
```

**Integration Points**:

## ⚠️ **ISSUES FOUND**

### 🔴 Critical Issues: NONE ✅
All critical issues from previous audit have been fixed.

### 🟡 Medium Issues: 0

### 🟢 Minor Recommendations: 2

#### 1. Add Billing Email Notifications
**Current State**: Auto-conversion happens silently  
**Recommendation**: Send email when trial converts to paid  
**Impact**: Low - users can check billing dashboard  
**Priority**: Nice-to-have

**Suggested Implementation**:
```typescript
// In auto-convert-trials/index.ts after successful conversion
await supabase.functions.invoke('send-upgrade-confirmation', {
  body: { userId: trial.user_id, email: trial.email }
});
```

#### 2. Add Billing Dashboard Widget
**Current State**: Billing info only on dedicated page  
**Recommendation**: Add billing summary widget to main dashboard  
**Impact**: Low - improves UX  
**Priority**: Nice-to-have

SELECT 
  s.email,
  s.active_properties_count as db_count,
  COUNT(p.id) as actual_count,
  CASE 
    WHEN s.active_properties_count = COUNT(p.id) THEN '✅ Synced'
    ELSE '❌ Out of Sync'
  END as status
FROM subscribers s
LEFT JOIN properties p ON p.user_id = s.user_id
GROUP BY s.id, s.email, s.active_properties_count;
```

```sql
SELECT 
  event_type,
  COUNT(*) as count,
