### 4. Database Status

#### Current Subscriber Records (Sample from 5 users):
```
Total subscribers checked: 5
- 4 users: trial_start_date = NULL, trial_end_date = NULL (no trial started)
- 1 user: active trial with trial_end_date set, is_cancelled = true
- Active properties range: 0-3 properties
- All have payment_status = 'active'
- All have subscription_status = 'trialing'
```

#### Observations:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Most users have not started trials (trial dates are NULL)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è One user has a cancelled trial but dates extend to October 2025
- ‚úÖ Property counts are being tracked correctly
- ‚úÖ Database structure is correct for Phase 2

## üß™ Testing Status

### Manual Testing Available Through UI:
1. **Navigate to:** `/billing-security` (admin users only)
2. **Scroll to:** "Phase 2: Automated Billing Testing Panel"
3. **Available Tests:**
   - ‚úÖ Auto-Convert Trials button
   - ‚úÖ Adjust Billing button  
   - ‚úÖ Trial Reminders button
   - ‚úÖ Check Cron Jobs button

### Enhanced Error Handling Added:
- Console logging for all edge function calls
- Detailed error messages in toasts
- Response data logging for debugging
- Proper null/undefined handling

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Considerations

### Issue 1: Edge Function Not Responding
**Symptom:** UI shows loading spinner indefinitely when clicking "Auto-Convert Trials"  
**Possible Causes:**
1. Edge function deployment pending
2. CORS configuration issue
3. Network timeout
4. Missing STRIPE_SECRET_KEY environment variable

**Debug Steps Added:**
- Console logs now show function invocation attempts
- Error responses will be displayed in toast notifications
- Network tab will show actual HTTP status codes

### Issue 2: Limited Test Data
**Current State:** Only 1 user has trial dates set, most have NULL values  
**Impact:** Auto-convert and reminders won't trigger for users without trial_start_date/trial_end_date  
**Recommendation:** Create test users with:
- Trial ending today (for auto-convert testing)
- Trial ending in 7, 3, 1 days (for reminder testing)
- Active subscriptions with varying property counts (for billing adjustment testing)

### Issue 3: No Edge Function Logs Yet
**Status:** No logs found for any of the Phase 2 functions  
**Reason:** Functions haven't been triggered yet  
**Resolution:** After first manual trigger, logs will be available

   ```
   Filter: functions/v1/auto-convert-trials
   Look for: HTTP status code (200, 404, 500, etc.)
   Check: Response body for error details
   ```

3. **Check Edge Function Logs:**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard
   - Navigate to Edge Functions ‚Üí auto-convert-trials ‚Üí Logs
   - Look for deployment errors or runtime errors

4. **Verify Environment Variables:**
