# Phase 5: Property Management Integration - Complete ✅

## Overview
Phase 5 successfully integrates property management with the billing system and implements comprehensive access control based on subscription status.

## ✅ Task 5.1: Property Creation/Deletion Hooks - COMPLETE

### Enhanced Property Creation (`src/contexts/property/usePropertyProvider.ts`)
- **Automatic Billing Recalculation**: Property creation now triggers automatic billing updates through the existing `usePropertyBillingIntegration` hook
- **Removed Window Reload**: Replaced inefficient `window.location.reload()` with reactive billing updates
- **Improved User Feedback**: Better property creation confirmation messages

### Enhanced Property Deletion (`src/contexts/property/usePropertyProvider.ts`)
- **Smart Billing Adjustment**: Property deletion automatically adjusts billing calculations
- **Enhanced Feedback**: Displays property name in deletion confirmation
- **Reactive Updates**: Billing recalculation happens automatically without page refresh

### Advanced Billing Notifications (`src/hooks/usePropertyBillingIntegration.tsx`)
- **Property Addition Notifications**: Shows billing impact when properties are added
- **Property Removal Notifications**: Shows billing reduction when properties are removed
- **Trial vs Subscription Messaging**: Different notification styles for trial and subscribed users
- **Detailed Billing Info**: Shows exact cost changes and monthly billing amounts

## ✅ Task 5.2: Access Control Implementation - COMPLETE

### Core Access Control Hook (`src/hooks/usePropertyAccessControl.tsx`)
- **Permission Checking**: Determines if users can create, update, or delete properties
- **Status Detection**: Identifies trial expiration and cancellation states
- **Dynamic Messaging**: Provides context-appropriate access messages
- **Action Restriction**: Handles restricted actions with appropriate user feedback

### Property Access Guard Component (`src/components/property/PropertyAccessGuard.tsx`)
- **Conditional Rendering**: Shows appropriate UI based on subscription status
- **Trial Expired UI**: Custom interface for users with expired trials
- **Cancelled Subscription UI**: Dedicated interface for cancelled users with reactivation prompts
- **Seamless Integration**: Wraps existing components without disrupting functionality

### Enhanced Property Action Button (`src/components/property/PropertyActionButton.tsx`)
- **Access-Controlled Actions**: Buttons that respect subscription status
- **Smart Error Handling**: Provides appropriate feedback when actions are restricted
- **Consistent UX**: Maintains design consistency while adding access control

## 🔄 Integration Points

### Updated Property Pages
- **Properties List** (`src/pages/Properties.tsx`): Now uses `PropertyAccessGuard` for access control
- **Property Detail** (`src/pages/PropertyDetail.tsx`): Enhanced with access control for property actions
- **Property Forms**: Protected with access control for creation and editing

### Dashboard Integration
- **Property Management Widget** (`src/components/dashboard/PropertyManagementWidget.tsx`): New dashboard widget showing property status with billing alerts
- **Billing Alerts** (`src/components/billing/PropertyBillingAlert.tsx`): Context-aware alerts for trial and cancelled users
- **Enhanced Dashboard** (`src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`): Includes new property management widget
